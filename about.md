Hi, this is JJ (朱家傑). I grew up in Shanghai, China, where I studied pure mathematics for my undergraduate degree at Fudan University. Following that, I received doctoral training in numerical analysis and optimization during my Ph.D. study with Prof.*William Hager* at the University of Florida. After moving to Europe to continue my research career, I learned the principles of robust optimization and model predictive control from Prof. *Moritz Diehl* during a research stay at the University of Freiburg. I am currently a postdoctoral researcher in machine learning at the Empirical Inference Department, Max Planck Institute for Intelligent Systems in Tübingen, Germany, where I learned the theory of kernel methods and statistical machine learning from Prof. *Bernhard Schölkopf* and colleagues. In my spare time, I enjoy reading science fiction, history, and hiking.
