Hi, this is JJ (朱家傑). I grew up in Shanghai, China, where I studied pure mathematics for my undergraduate degree at Fudan University. Following that, I received doctoral training in numerical optimization during my Ph.D. study with Prof.* William Hager* at the University of Florida. After living in the U.S., I moved to Europe to continue my research career. I learned the principles of robust control and optimization from Prof. *Moritz Diehl* during a research stay at the University of Freiburg. I am currently undergoing postdoctoral training in machine learning at Empirical Inference Department, Max Planck Institute for Intelligent Systems in Tübingen, Germany. Here, I learned kernel methods and the theory of reproducing kernel Hilbert space from Prof. *Bernhard Schölkopf* and colleagues. In my spare time, I enjoy reading science fiction, history, and hiking.
