Hi, this is JJ (朱家傑). I grew up in Shanghai, China. In 2010, I graduated with a B.Sc. degree in mathematics from [Fudan University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fudan_University). Following that, I studied with Prof. [Bill Hager](http://people.clas.ufl.edu/hager/) at the University of Florida. In 2015, I received a Ph.D. degree in mathematics and statistics co-major. Currently, I live in  Tübingen, Germany. In my spare time, I enjoy reading science fiction and hiking.
