Hi, this is JJ (朱家傑). I grew up in Shanghai, China. I studied pure mathematics for undergraduate at [Fudan University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fudan_University). Following that, I received doctoral training in numerical analysis & optimization during my PhD study with *Prof. William Hager* at the University of Florida. After living in the U.S. for a long time, I moved to Tübingen, Germany. I learned the principles of robust control and optimization from *Prof. Moritz Diehl*. Currently, I am undergoing postdoctoral training in machine learning at MPI for Intelligent Systems, where I learned kernel methods and the theory of reproducing kernel Hilbert space from *Prof. Bernhard Schölkopf* and colleagues. In my spare time, I enjoy reading science fiction, history, and hiking.
