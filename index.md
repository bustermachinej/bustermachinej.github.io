Hi, this is J.J. Zhu. I am a postdoctoral researcher at the [Max Planck Institute for Intelligent Systems](http://is.tue.mpg.de/), at the [Empirical Inference](https://ei.is.tuebingen.mpg.de/) Department.

### Short bio

I studied mathematics for undergraduate at [Fudan University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fudan_University). Following that, I received doctoral training in numerical analysis & optimization during my PhD study with *Prof. William Hager* at the University of Florida. I am undergoing postdoctoral training in machine learning (with *Prof. Bernhard Sch√∂lkopf*) as well as in control (with *Prof. Moritz Diehl*). 

### Research interests
+ Robust and data-driven optimization
+ Stochastic systems and model predictive control
+ Robustness of machine learning algorithms
+ Numerical optimization and analysis

I have two seemingly conflicting overarching goals:

1. Making real-life robust multi-stage decisions using optimization, control, and data
   -- second-class scholars publish papers and get cited by peers, first-class scholars make it work and get tested by reality 
2. Advancing mathematical theory that has absolutely no practical usage (at the moment)
   -- insight must proceed applications

### If you are a student looking for research opportunities...

Please write a short email without too much copy-paste about the courses and projects you have done in ML/optimization/control. Please also include your CV or resume :)
