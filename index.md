Hi, this is J.J. Zhu. I am a postdoctoral researcher at the [Max Planck Institute for Intelligent Systems](http://is.tue.mpg.de/), at the [Empirical Inference](https://ei.is.tuebingen.mpg.de/) Department.

I received doctoral training in numerical analysis & optimization during my PhD study with *Prof. William Hager* at the University of Florida. Currently, I am undergoing postdoctoral training in machine learning (mentored by *Prof. Bernhard Sch√∂lkopf*) as well as in optimization and control (jointly mentored by *Prof. Moritz Diehl*). 

Lately, I have been working on developing the framework of using kernel methods as tools for optimization and control (example [here](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2004.00166.pdf); not to be confused with optimization for kernel methods). 

### Research interests
+ Robust and data-driven optimization
+ Robust control and systems
+ Robustness of machine learning algorithms
+ Numerical optimization and analysis
