### Research interests

In general, I am an *applied mathematician* interested in **optimization, function spaces, probability, data, systems, and control**. More specifically, I am interested in the following technical topics.

+ (Distributionally) Robust optimization, stochastic optimization
+ Numerical analysis, numerical optimization
+ Machine learning, kernel methods
+ Stochastic systems, control, reinforcement learning
