Hi, this is J.J. Zhu. I am a postdoctoral researcher at the [Max Planck Institute for Intelligent Systems](http://is.tue.mpg.de/), at the [Empirical Inference](https://ei.is.tuebingen.mpg.de/) Department.

### Research interests

In general, I am interested in **data-driven decision-making and dynamical systems**. More specifically, I am interested in the following technical topics.

+ Robust and stochastic optimization
+ Stochastic systems and model predictive control
+ Reinforcement learning and machine learning
+ Numerical optimization and analysis

### If you are a student looking for internship or research opportunities

Please write a short email and include:

- CV/resume
- 1-page research statement about the relevant projects and course works
- Scanned transcripts of undergrad and graduate studies
