Hi, this is J.J. Zhu. I am a research group head at the [Weierstrass Institute, Berlin](https://www.wias-berlin.de/). I am also an affiliated researcher at the [Empirical Inference Department](https://ei.is.tuebingen.mpg.de/), [Max Planck Institute for Intelligent Systems, TÃ¼bingen](http://is.tue.mpg.de/).

My group focuses on the *mathematical foundations and applications of machine learning and data-driven optimization & control, especially on robustness (distributional robustness/adversarial robustness/generalization/causal intervention/robust optimization), and interfacing dynamical systems and learning*.

Please feel free to [get in touch](mailto:zplusj@gmail.com) if you are a prospective student (more information coming soon).

### Research interests

In general, I am an *applied mathematician* interested in **optimization, machine learning (with a focus on distributional robustness), function spaces, dynamical systems, and control**. More specifically, I am interested in the following technical topics.

+ Machine learning, distributional robustness, kernel methods
+ Numerical analysis, numerical optimization
+ Distributionally robust optimization, stochastic optimization
+ Dynamical systems, control
