Hi, this is J.J. Zhu. I am a postdoctoral researcher at the [Max Planck Institute for Intelligent Systems](http://is.tue.mpg.de/), at the [Empirical Inference](https://ei.is.tuebingen.mpg.de/) Department.

### Research interests

In general, I am interested in decision-making and dynamical systems. More specifically, I am interested in the following technical topics.

+ Data-driven and robust optimization
+ Stochastic systems and model predictive control
+ Robustness in machine learning and reinforcement learning
+ Numerical optimization and analysis

I have two seemingly conflicting overarching goals:

1. Making real-life robust multi-stage decisions using optimization, control, and data

   -- second-class scholars (my current self included) publish papers and get cited by peers, first-class scholars get tested by reality and time 

2. Advancing mathematical theory that has absolutely no practical usage (at the moment)

   -- insight must proceed applications

### If you are a student looking for internship or research opportunities

Please write a short email and include:

- CV/resume
- 1-page research statement about the relevant projects and course works
- Scanned transcripts of undergrad and graduate studies
