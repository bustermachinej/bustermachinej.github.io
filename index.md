Hi, this is J.J. Zhu. I am a postdoctoral researcher at the [Max Planck Institute for Intelligent Systems, TÃ¼bingen](http://is.tue.mpg.de/), at the [Empirical Inference Department](https://ei.is.tuebingen.mpg.de/).

### Update

- Starting in June, I will be the head of a research group (~ assistant professor in North America systems) at the [Weierstrass Institute, Berlin](https://www.wias-berlin.de/). 
  - My group will focus on the *mathematical foundation of machine learning and data-driven control, especially on robustness, generalization, optimization, and dynamical systems*.
  - Please feel free to [get in touch](mailto:zplusj@gmail.com) if you are a prospective student (more information coming soon).

### Research interests

In general, I am an *applied mathematician* interested in **optimization, function spaces, probability, data, systems, and control**. More specifically, I am interested in the following technical topics.

+ (Distributionally) Robust optimization, stochastic optimization
+ Machine learning, kernel methods
+ Numerical analysis, numerical optimization
+ Stochastic systems, control, reinforcement learning
