Hi, this is J.J. Zhu. I am a postdoctoral researcher at the [Max Planck Institute for Intelligent Systems](http://is.tue.mpg.de/) and Marie Skłodowska-Curie Fellow funded by the European Union. I focus on optimization, control, as well as machine learning.

### Training & short bio

I received doctoral training in numerical analysis & optimization during my PhD study with *Prof. William Hager* at the University of Florida.

Currently, I am undergoing postdoctoral training in machine learning (mentored by *Prof. Bernhard Schölkopf*) as well as in optimization and control (jointly mentored by *Prof. Moritz Diehl*). I greatly appreciate this opportunity to learn from many experts (senior and junior) in the greater Europe area.
