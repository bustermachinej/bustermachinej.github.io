Hi, this is J.J. Zhu. I am a postdoctoral researcher at the [Max Planck Institute for Intelligent Systems](http://is.tue.mpg.de/), at the [Empirical Inference](https://ei.is.tuebingen.mpg.de/) Department.

### Research interests

In general, I am an applied mathematician interested in **optimization, probability, data, and dynamical systems**. More specifically, I am interested in the following technical topics.

+ Robust and stochastic optimization
+ Model predictive control and stochastic systems
+ Numerical optimization and analysis
+ Functional analysis and applied probability theory
+ Robustness in machine learning
